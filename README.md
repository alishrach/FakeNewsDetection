# FakeNewsDetection
# Project Overview

Welcome to my very first machine learning project! This repository contains my work on a Fake News Detection system using logistic regression, developed as I learn and explore the fundamentals of machine learning.

Objective:
The main objective of this project is to develop a ML model capable of distinguishing between real and fake news articles.

Methodology:
Logistic Regression has been employed as the ML model to solve this classification problem.

# Model Details
Algorithm: Logistic Regression

Libraries Used:

pandas: For data manipulation and ingestion.

numpy: For numerical operations.

re: For regular expressions, used in text preprocessing.

nltk: Natural Language Toolkit, used for stopwords removal and stemming.

scikit-learn: For creating machine learning models, specifically logistic regression, and for splitting the data and evaluating the model.

TfidfVectorizer: From scikit-learn, used to convert text data into TF-IDF feature vectors.

# Model Performance:
The model achieved an accuracy of:

Training Accuracy: 98.67%

Testing Accuracy: 97.91%

# Acknowledgements
This project was motivated and guided by the concepts presented in Siddhardhan's tutorial. It provided me with the insights into the model selection and preparation methods required for this type of analysis.
